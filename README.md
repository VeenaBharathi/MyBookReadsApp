You can also move the books among the shelves or move it to 'none' so that the book disappears from  the 'my reads' stack page.

Getting Started

https://github.com/VeenaBharathi/MyBookReadsApp.git

Prerequisites
* Git Bash
* Browser
* Sublime Test2

Install steps
* git clone <above repository> into any local folder.
* Run npm install, npm install react-router-dom, npm install react-route and the application is ready to use.
* Right click on index.html and open with chrome and you can view jasmine test results!

Instructions

1. The main page has 3 stacks or shelves - 'Currently Reading, 'Want to Read','Read' along with a add button

2. The user can move the books between the shelves or c hosose to add a new book by clicking on add icon, which takes user to search page, search book by name and move the boook to appropriate shelf.

3.The search page has a back button which will take the user back to main page.
  
4.The result books in the search page must show the appropriate shelf name selected.

Built With
* Sublime Text Editor

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

```

Remember that good React design practice is to create new JS files for each component and use import/require statements to include them where they are needed.

## Backend Server

To simplify your development process, we've provided a backend server for you to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]  
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query)
```

* query: `<String>`
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of a maximum of 20 book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
